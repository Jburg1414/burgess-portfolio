        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hey my name is Jace Burgess. I am currently enrolled in Coding Bootcamp to learn how to create webpages,
            write code, and just get my feet wet in the tech world. My day job is working on heavy equipment although I
            don't plan on doing that long term which is why I'm going through coding bootcamp! I have always been
            interested in computers and technology. I have learned how to code in HTML and CSS so far. I can't wait to
            learn more coding languages and how to connect front end work to the backend. I am excited to learn more
            about technology in general and to be able to expand my knowledge. </p>

        <p>I would love to be able to get a job where I can work remotely and be able to spend time traveling with my
            family. I enjoy spending time outdoors, hunting, and seeing different areas of the country. I am an Arizona
            native who still finds new places to visit within the state. I enjoy spending time up North at my families
            cabin during summer. </p>
