            <p>Hey my name is Jace Burgess. I am currently enrolled in Coding Bootcamp to learn how to create webpages,
                write code, and just get my feet wet in the tech world. My day job is working on heavy equipment
                although I
                don't plan on doing that long term which is why I'm going through coding bootcamp! I have always been
                interested in computers and technology. I have learned how to code in HTML and CSS so far. I can't wait
                to
                learn more coding languages and how to connect front end work to the backend. I am excited to learn more
                about technology in general and to be able to expand my knowledge. </p>

            <p>I would love to be able to get a job where I can work remotely and be able to spend time traveling with
                my
                family. I enjoy spending time outdoors, hunting, and seeing different areas of the country. I am an
                Arizona
                native who still finds new places to visit within the state. I enjoy spending time up North at my
                families
                cabin during summer. </p>
